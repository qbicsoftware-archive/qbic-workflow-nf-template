# QBIC-megSAP-NGS
Nextflow workflows for the analysis of samples using the megSAP pipeline.

### Introduction

The QBIC-megSAP-NGS pipeline is a medical genetics pipeline based on best-practices from imgag/megSAP and is primarily used for Exome analysis at our core-facility at [QBIC](https://qbic.life), Germany.

### Documentation

The pipeline itself is developed at the [Institute for Medical Genetics](https://github.com/imgag/megSAP) in Tuebingen, Germany. The accompanying scripts within this repository were however written for use at the [QBIC](https://qbic.life) and our local clusters CFC and [BinAC](http://www.zdv.uni-tuebingen.de/dienstleistungen/computing/hardware/binac.html). 

### Credits

Credits for the actual pipeline implementation should go to [Marc Sturm](https://github.com/imgag/megSAP) and other contributors. See the respective repository for the development of the actual pipeline. The NextFlow pipeline and parts of this repository here have been implemented by Alex Peltzer ([@apeltzer](https://github.com/apeltzer)). Special thanks to Phil Ewels and Rickard Hammarén at SciLifeLab for providing templates, ideas and their own [pipeline](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/NGI-RNAseq) as a best-practice template for us when developing our own pipeline.
